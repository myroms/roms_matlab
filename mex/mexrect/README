MEXRECT

COMPILE NOTES
=======================================================================
R2006a, Mandriva 2007, Linux X86:
    g77 : gcc3.3-g77-3.3.6-3mdk

    At the unix command line, issue the command "mex mexmexrect.F"

R2006a, Centos 4.4, Linux X86_64:
    g77 : gcc-g77-3.4.6-3

    At the unix command line, issue the command "mex mexmexrect.F"

R2006a, Mandriva 2006, Linux X86_64:
    g77 : gcc3.3-g77-3.3.6-3mdk

    At the unix command line, issue the command "mex mexmexrect.F"

R14sp2, Mandriva 2006, Linux X86_64:
    g77 : gcc3.3-g77-3.3.6-3mdk

    Copy the file ${MATLAB}/bin/mexopts.sh into the current directory.  
    Edit line 149, changing it from
            FLIBS="$RPATH $MLIBS -lm -lstdc++"
    to
            FLIBS="$RPATH $MLIBS -lm /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.5"
    I believe that one has to do this because the default libstdc++ 
    on this version of Mandriva is libstdc++.so.6.0.5, while matlab was
    compiled with libstdc++.so.5

    At the unix command line, issue the command "mex mexmexrect.F"

R14sp2, Solaris 2.8:
    f90: Sun WorkShop 6 2000/04/07 FORTRAN 95 6.0

    At the unix command line, type "mex mexrect.F"


In order to test things out, start up matlab and issue the command

    >> test_mexrect
